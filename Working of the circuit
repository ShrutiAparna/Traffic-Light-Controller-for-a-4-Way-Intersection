The code for a Traffic Light Controller uses a Finite State Machine (FSM) to control a four-way traffic intersection with north, south, east, and west directions. 

- Inputs: “clk” (clock signal) and `rst_a` (reset signal).
- Outputs: 3-bit signals for lights in each direction (`n_lights`, `s_lights`, `e_lights`, `w_lights`).
The FSM cycles through the following sequence of light states for each direction:
- Green light ("001") for 8 clock cycles.
- Yellow light ("010") for 4 clock cycles.
- Red light ("100") as the default state.

The FSM transitions between north, south, east, and west states in order, and the cycle repeats. On reset, the FSM starts in the north state.
